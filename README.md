Library Management System (C++)
The Library Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ for managing books, members, and transactions within a library. The system provides essential library functionalities, including catalog management, book issuance, and member handling, while demonstrating principles of object-oriented programming and file handling in C++.

Features
Add and manage books with details such as title, author, and publication year.

Register and maintain library member records.

Search for books by title, author, or ID.

Issue and return books with tracking of availability status.

Maintain a transaction log for borrowed and returned books.

Simplified text-driven interface for efficient interaction.

Technology Stack
Programming Language: C++

Core Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism), File Handling, Exception Handling

Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists (optional based on implementation)
